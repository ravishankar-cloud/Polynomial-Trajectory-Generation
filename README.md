# Polynomial-Trajectory-Generation

ptg.py - The primary code for generating a polynomial trajectory for some constraints. This is also where weights are assigned to cost functions. Adjusting these weights (and possibly adding new cost functions), can have a big effect on vehicle behavior.


cost_functions.py - This file contains many cost functions which are used in ptg.py when selecting the best trajectory. Some cost functions aren't yet implemented...


evaluate_ptg.py - This file sets a start state, goal, and traffic conditions and runs the PTG code. Feel free to modify the goal, add traffic, etc... to test your vehicle's trajectory generation ability.


constants.py - constants like speed limit, vehicle size, etc...


helpers.py - helper functions used by other files.
